# Akeeba GeoIP provider plugin

This plugin used to provide country-level geographic IP services using MaxMind's GeoLite2 database.

> This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from
[http://www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com).

# OBSOLETE - NO LONGER MAINTAINED

On December 18th, 2019, MaxMind [announced signifficant changes in the licensing and distribution](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/) of their GeoLite2 data. As a result we had to discontinue this plugin. For the reasoning please [refer to our December 30th, 2019 announcement](https://www.akeebabackup.com/news/1727-removal-of-geographic-ip-features-from-akeeba-software.html).
